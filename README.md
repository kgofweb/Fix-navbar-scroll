Set navigation to scroll


Set Navigation bar to scroll in JavaScript

I have used several ways to perform the same exercise

`offsetHeight`: set the Height of an element

`scrollY`: The number of pixels on the scroll

`pageYOffset`: The number of pixels on the scroll

`offsetTop`: the number of pixels between an element and the top of the viewport
